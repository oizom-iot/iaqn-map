# Indian Air Quality Network

Welcome to the Indian Air Quality Network (IAQN)! This platform provides insightful, real-time information on air quality across the **North Indian belt** through various visualizations and data tools. Our mission is to raise awareness of air quality issues and empower users with accurate data to make informed decisions.

In this documentation, we will explain the features of our platform, the terminology we use, and how to interpret the data.

## Key Features of IAQN

### 1. **Heatmaps for PM2.5 & PM10**
On our interactive map, we display heatmaps representing the concentration of **PM2.5** and **PM10** particles across the **North Indian belt**. Heatmaps provide a color-coded representation of air quality, with areas showing higher concentrations of pollutants marked in warmer colors (like red) and lower concentrations in cooler colors (like blue).

#### **What are PM2.5 and PM10?**
- **PM2.5** refers to particulate matter that is 2.5 micrometers or smaller in diameter. These tiny particles are small enough to enter the lungs and bloodstream, potentially causing serious health problems like respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.
- **PM10** refers to particulate matter that is 10 micrometers or smaller in diameter. Although larger than PM2.5, PM10 can still affect health, especially when inhaled in significant amounts.

The heatmaps are dynamically generated based on real-time data collected from various sensor stations located across the **North Indian belt**.

### 2. **Fire Events Visualization**
We also highlight ongoing **fire events** across India, with a focus on areas in the **North Indian belt**. These fire events are marked by specific icons, and the map updates to show their current locations. This helps in monitoring air quality in areas impacted by seasonal burning, forest fires, and industrial activities that release harmful pollutants into the atmosphere.

### 3. **Sensor Stations (Pinpointed Locations)**
The data on air quality is collected by our network of **sensor stations**, which are located across the **North Indian belt**. These stations track air quality data, including the concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10, as well as other relevant parameters like temperature and humidity.

On the map, each sensor station is represented by a pin or marker, providing users with easy access to the air quality readings for that location.

### 4. **Control Bar (Time-Series Data)**
At the bottom of the map, we provide a **control bar** that allows users to interact with the daily time-series data. By using the play button on the control bar, users can play through the air quality data for a specific day, viewing how PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations change over time. This feature provides valuable insights into daily air quality trends.

### 5. **Switch Between Map Layers**
Users can switch between different map layers to adjust the appearance of the map and visualize different data types or overlay styles. For instance, you can view the air quality data alongside other environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, or even satellite imagery of fire events.

### 6. **Website Guide & GitHub Repository Access**
In the top right corner of the map, there are two useful buttons:
- **Step-by-Step Website Guide**: Clicking this button will open a guided tutorial that walks users through the different features of the platform. It helps new users get familiar with how to navigate the site and interpret the data.
- **GitHub Repository**: This button links directly to our GitHub repository where users can access the open-source code, contribute to the project, report issues, or just learn more about how the platform works.

## Terminology and Jargon

To make sure everyone understands the technical terms, here’s a glossary of key terms you will encounter on the platform:

- **PM2.5**: Particulate matter that is less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter. It is small enough to enter the lungs and bloodstream and is a major health concern.
- **PM10**: Particulate matter that is less than 10 micrometers in diameter. Though larger than PM2.5, it can still cause health problems.
- **Heatmap**: A visual representation of data where individual values are represented by colors. In our case, the heatmap shows concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 across a geographic area.
- **Fire Events**: Locations across India (focused on the North Indian belt) where active fires are detected. These may be forest fires, agricultural burns, or industrial fires that contribute to air pollution.
- **Sensor Stations**: Physical devices that collect air quality data at various locations across the **North Indian belt**. These stations track real-time concentrations of pollutants like PM2.5 and PM10.
- **Control Bar**: A feature at the bottom of the map that allows users to interact with time-series data, playing through daily air quality trends.
- **Map Layers**: Different layers of information that can be overlaid on the map, such as air quality data, satellite images, or temperature maps.

## Understanding the Heatmap

### **How is the Heatmap Generated?**
The heatmap is generated using data collected from the sensor stations. The data is processed to calculate the concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 at various points in the **North Indian belt**. These concentrations are then visualized using a color gradient:
- Red and yellow represent high concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10.
- Green and blue represent lower concentrations.

Users can refer to the **scale** provided in the control bar at the bottom of the map to map colors to values (e.g., a red area might correspond to a PM2.5 value above 100 µg/m³, while a blue area might correspond to values below 10 µg/m³).

### **Reading the Heatmap**
To interpret the heatmap effectively:
1. Look for areas with the deepest reds and yellows to identify regions with high pollution levels.
2. The colors on the scale at the bottom will show you how much PM2.5 or PM10 is present at any given location.
3. Pay attention to fire events, as these can often lead to higher pollution in nearby areas.

## Conclusion

The **Indian Air Quality Network** is an essential tool for monitoring and understanding air quality across the **North Indian belt**. Whether you're concerned about the health impacts of air pollution, tracking fire events, or simply curious about the air quality in your area, our platform provides the tools you need to stay informed.

Feel free to explore the heatmaps, interact with the time-series data, and use the various layers and controls to customize your view. And remember, you can always check the guide or GitHub repository for further details and ways to contribute to the project.

Happy exploring!
